Description:
	This project is inspired from a Simon color game, in which the player must follow
	a random sequence of lighting LEDs, and then reproducing it by pressing the corresponding 
	buttons in order.

Hardware:
	- 5xLEDs(blue, red, green, yellow, orange)
	-5 current-limiting resistor (220-330 ohm)
	- Arduino Uno board
	- LCD screen 
	- breadboard(preferably 2)
	- 5 push-buttons 
	- jumper wires

Connections:
- all the buttons are wired in the analog pins as follows:
	-RED_button on pin A0
	-BLUE_button on pin A1
	-GREEN_button on pin A2
	-ORANGE_button on pin A3
	-YELLOW_button on pin A4

-the LEDs are connected as follows:
	-RED_led on pin 2
	-BLUE_led on pin 3
	-GREEN_led on pin 4
	-ORANGE_led on pin 5
	-YELLOW_led on pin 6
	-Don't forget to add the current-limiting resistors

-the LCD screen is a HD44780 model , with 16 parallel pins
	rs = 12, en = 13, d4 = 10, d5 = 9, d6 = 8, d7 = 7
	the potentiometer is connected to V0 pin


Feel free to change the pinout as you like, but don't forget to change the software accordingly:)
